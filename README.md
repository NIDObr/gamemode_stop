# gamemode_stop
Stops gamemode after a specified program is closed, preventing it from running in the background even when the game is stopped

### $ gamemode_stop < game_name >

The "game_name" can be obtained by monitoring the Monitor process of your system, I recommend that you use "pidof" to validate the "game_name" (if it returns the PID it is correct).
